            <p>“First, I’ll say I’ll be killed for anything I say,” McCarthy jokingly replied, before sharing a heartwarming story. “Secondly, we were on set and they just started playing Halle’s version of the song.”</p>

            <p>At this point, though she didn’t reveal which song she was referring to, the actress begins to tear up, adding, “I had a truly, really — not weird reaction, just overwhelming. It’s so beautiful and it’s from such a — it’s just different. That
                girl has got roots down and she sings from her heart. When I heard it, there were like seven of us that just burst out crying because we had not heard it.
            </p>

            <p>“She is a remarkable young woman in every moment, how she is on set, how she is as a person and I burst out crying,” she continued. “And now I realize, now she’s thinking, ‘There’s a really old woman in front of me crying and this is weird.’
                But I couldn’t get it together.”</p>
